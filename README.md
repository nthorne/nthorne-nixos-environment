# Description

This repository contains my NixOS configuration files, as well
as some assorted dotfiles.

# Installation

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<HOSTNAME>
```

# Secrets management

Secrets are managed using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix), or
[git-agecrypt](https://github.com/vlaci/git-agecrypt), depending on whether
the secret is needed at build time or run time.

## Keys

Age keys need to be stored in ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt, and /etc/sops/age/keys.txt
(for vimes), as the home partition is decrypted at login.

## Temporary

In order to fix broken ath10k driver, I also copied the firmware-5.bin from
/nix/store/ for the QCA9377 that was closest to december, and added a nix
package for it, and included that package within `hardware-configuration.nix`.
This change should be reverted once the driver issue has been fixed for NixOS.

# Misc

## Fixing missing build environment dependency

I think that a dependency somehow got GC'd, even though it was
needed. To fix this, I ran the following command:

```sh
sudo nix-store --verify --check-contents --repair
just update default
```
